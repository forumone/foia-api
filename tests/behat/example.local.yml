# Here is an example file for overriding the Behat configuration in order to
# use it in a non-ddev environment. To use this, copy this file to "local.yml"
# (which is not versioned) and then tweak the file as needed. The example
# below demonstrates how to change the base_url according to your local
# environment, and how to change some paths according to your project location.
# When you run the /vendor/bin/behat command, use this configuration instead of
# behat.yml. For example: vendor/bin/behat --config=tests/behat/local.yml
